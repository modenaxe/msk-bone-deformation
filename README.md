# Bone deformation tool

This repository is used for sharing a MATLAB toolbox that enables researcher in biomechanics to modify their generic musculoskeletal models by applying arbitrary torsion profiles to the long axis of the bone model.

The toolbox works with musculoskeletal models in the format provided for the software for biomechanical analyses [OpenSim](https://opensim.stanford.edu/).


# Requirements

In order to use this MATLAB package it is necessary to:
* install MATLAB (v2020a was used for development of the toolbox)
* install OpenSim 3.3
* setup the OpenSim API (Application User Interface) for MATLAB as described [at this link](http://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu:8080/display/OpenSim/Scripting+with+Matlab).
